# Project Blueprint

## Overview

A community Vision app that helps tenants and landlords to easily manage their rental properties.
The app will allow landlords to list their properties, and tenants to search for properties, apply for them, and pay their rent.
The app will also have a feature that allows tenants to report maintenance issues, and landlords to track the status of these issues.

## Features

- **Property listings:** Landlords can create and manage property listings, including details like rent, size, amenities, and photos.
- **Tenant applications:** Tenants can submit applications for rental properties directly through the app.
- **Online rent payments:** Tenants can pay their rent securely online, and landlords can track payments.
- **Maintenance requests:** Tenants can report maintenance issues, and landlords can manage and track the resolution process.
- **Communication tools:** In-app messaging for easy communication between tenants and landlords.
- **Dark mode:** The app will have a "dark mode" feature.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Flutter
- **Backend:** Firebase

    *   Display a list of properties with an image, name, location, and price.
    *   Add a search bar at the top to search for properties by name or location.
    *   Implement a bottom navigation bar with three tabs: "Dashboard", "Properties", and "Profile".
2.  **Implement Theme:**
